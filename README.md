Chattie is a basic chat application that connects users into one room. 

The functionalities it currently has are: choosing a username, assigning a random robot icon, displaying the number of users in the room, displaying the names of active users, and a logout button.

Tech-stack: JS (ES6+), React (functional and class components), Scaledrone service (api), HTML, CSS

Given that Chattie was designed as a final project for Algebra's course, this number of functionalities was sufficient. However, in the future, the application will receive: emojis, the ability to choose the color of icons and text, a graphical redesign, and the ability to choose multiple rooms depending on users' interests.

Chattie uses the Scaledrone service to create and open channels for communication, and is developed as a React app.
